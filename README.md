# Kite Academy Stockholm
Kite Academy Stockholm is a website that aims to attract the attention of potential as well as already committed kitesurfers. The site is a display window for an organization specialising in teaching kite surfing to all interested. The content is focused around services offered to visitors with a clear call to action to sign up for one of the services offered by the academy.

The main page states the purpose and beliefs of the Academy as an introduction, while displaying a set of inspiring images showing kite-surfing on water and on snow. The main page displays information about the range of services offered, the events planned. 

The main page leads over to a second page focusing the equipment needed for kitesurfing. This page highlights how the Academy supports surfers in selecting and eventually acquiring their own equipment. Intersted parties can use a dedicated form to place an inquiry for assistance.

# Design
## Images
The images used on the site are chosen to promote the values communicated in text by Kite Academy Stockholm, which are typically "Fun", "Joy", "Nature". The images are further chosen to convey the idea that Kitesurfing is for everyone, that it can be mastered and that it is a social and inclusive sport that encourages the cooperation with other surfers. Finally, being based in Scandinavia, the summer period is not very long, why the Academy is active with training on snow during winter time, which is an important differentiator for this Academy, and promoted by the images

## Fonts
There are two fonts used in the website. Both quite simplistic and clean, quite natural and straight-forward. As is Kitesurfing. Modern, fast and clean.

## Colors 
The color scheme is based on shades of Blue, Orange and White. Blue is associated with the sea, Orange with the Sun and energy and White for cleanliness, distinction and snow. The choice of blue and orange, along with red, is very much used in the Kitesurfing domain on the Web.
