# Kite Academy Stockholm
Kite Academy Stockholm is a website that aims to attract the attention of potential as well as already committed kitesurfers. The site is a display window for an organization specialising in teaching kite surfing to all interested. The content is focused around services offered to visitors with a clear call to action to sign up for one of the services offered by the academy.

The main page states the purpose and beliefs of the Academy as an introduction, while displaying a set of inspiring images showing kite-surfing on water and on snow. The main page displays information about the range of services offered, the events planned. 

The main page leads over to a second page focusing the equipment needed for kitesurfing. This page highlights how the Academy supports surfers in selecting and eventually acquiring their own equipment. Intersted parties can use a dedicated form to place an inquiry for assistance.
